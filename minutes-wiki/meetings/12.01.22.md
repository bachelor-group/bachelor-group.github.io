# 12.01.22

## Agenda

  * Action items from the previous meeting
    - [done] working map (with some data)
    - [done] navbar
  * Discuss how we should import data from google api
    - Is it possible to use keys so that we can grab data with a specific date from the api? 
    (It is possible with [location](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data#use-the-data))
    - Options:
      - Load all data for each subject as user "requests" it, and put in global state (memory intensive? But applying more filters later will be quicker)
      - Load all data each time a new filter/category is requested (may be less memory intensive, but have to request more frequently data and drop unnecessary columns)
  * Start graph discussion
